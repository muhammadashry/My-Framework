# My-Framework
Designing Test Automation Framework using selenium Webdriver 
There were three main concepts kept in mind while building the framework which are Readability, Modularity, and minimizing the redundancy
This Framework:
• Designed with POM Pattern.
• Support Multiple Browsers.
• Using Data-Driven to read from Properties File, JSON File, CSV File, and XLSX.
• Reporting Using Allure and Taking a Screenshot.
• Build on Jenkins Integrated with GitHub.
• Run the Framework using XML.
• Headless Running.
• Support BDD using Cucumber.
• Run with Selenium Grid.
• API using RestAssured.
• Support Self-Healing using Helenium.
• Retring the failed tests using RetryAnalyzer.
